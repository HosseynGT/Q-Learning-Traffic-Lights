There is scope for them to be improved and to create an interactive interface for users to place roads.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\nThe current system features:\r\n* Multiple traffic lights\r\n* Multiple intersections\r\n* Two-way traffic\r\n* Amber lights\r\n\r\nFurther possible features include:\r\n* Corner turning traffic\r\n* Advanced graphics - drag and drop road/light placement\r\n* Different speed cars\r\n* Different-laned intersections\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@bethc, Gill Morris and Nathan Wilson built this in early 2012 as a project for their university Machine Learning course (UNSW COMP9417)."}
