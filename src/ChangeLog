	* Action.java: now exists

	* TrafficLight.java: added method `clock'

	* Main.java: adheres to the updated TrafficLight and 
	             LearnerModule interfaces.

	* LearningModule.java: started merging aforementioned code from 
	                       beth's TrafficLight into LearningModule.
	                       not finished so the new code is commented.

	* .: clarification: from the first bit of code I read I 
	     concluded that for loops are written "for (T t : C)\n{". 

	* ChangeLog: now exists.

	* CarImpl.java:
	- changed position, velocity and direction to be private
	- removed the restriction that direction is 1 or -1
	- in function `updateVelocity':
	    - highlighted a quirk regarding 'horizontal' and
	      'vertical' but then did nothing about it
	    - reformatted so it fits on my screen
	    - changed the commentary somewhat
	- renamed `getPosition' to `getCoords' to be consistent with
	  class `TrafficLight'
	- suggested renaming `removeIfOffRoad' but then did nothing
	  about it

	* RoadMapImpl.java:
	- changed gridSize to be public final
	- defined private final char carChar = 'C'
	- added a defaultEntrances array
	    - modified code throughout file to use this 
	      appropriately
	- in function `print':
	    - reformatted so it fits on my screen
	    - changed bottom for loop to be consistent with the rest of
	      the project
	- minor reformatting to `addCars' and `nextNonCarSquare...'
	- gave up adding "??" comments every time I saw an @Override
	  that didn't appear to override anything

	* Main.java:
	- formatting
	- reformatted some things
	- adjusted the layout of function `main'

	* LearningModule.java: now features a `learn' method which 
	should be called after the effects of `updateTrafficLights' 
	have been implemented. Changed signature of 
	`updateTrafficLights'.
